# LUBP - Learning Unitary Branching Programs

LUBP implements an heuristic for the problem of learning unitary branching programs.

## Download

Open a windows/linux terminal and execute the following command 
to clone this repository. 

```
git clone https://github.com/AutoProving/LUBP.git

git submodule init

git submodule update
```


## Compilation

Enter the main folder `LUBP` and type `make BUILD-LUBP` to compile the program. 

An executable called `LUBP.exe` will be created in the root folder. 


To compile our program, type "make" in a linux terminal. Please note that the compilation
involves both the files of our programs and the files of the external library ROPTLIB.
The compilation may take some minutes (3 min). 

The following requirements must be satisfied in order for the program to be compiled correctly. 

a) You should use g++ 10.0 or greater and compile with C++ 14 or greater
b) You will need the BLAS, LAPACK and FFTW to be able to compile our program. To install these
libraries, use the following commands. 

- sudo apt-get install build-essential
-	sudo apt-get install liblapack*
-	sudo apt-get install libblas*
-	sudo apt-get install libfftw3*
